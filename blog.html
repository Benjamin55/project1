        <h1>The Lay of the Laptop Land</h1>
        <p>The laptop market has undergone major changes in the past few years, and there's likely to be more confusion in the notebook aisle now than at any other time. Today's models encompass everything from featherweight, business-savvy ultraportables that barely tip the scales at less than 2 pounds, to lap-crushing gaming behemoths of 10 pounds or more.

                Your standard laptop doesn't look the way it once did, either, with dozens of convertible designs that rethink the standard clamshell to take advantage of touch interfaces. Some laptops double as tablets, with hinges that bend and fold, while other touch-enabled PCs are actually slate tablets that come with hardware keyboards for notebook-style use. There's simply too much variety in the laptop space for one size or style to fit every person's needs.
                
                That's where this buying guide comes in. We'll brief you on all the latest designs and specs, and parse the current trends, helping you figure out which features you need and how to find the laptop you really want.</p>

        <h1>Finding the Best 12- to 13-Inch Laptop</h1>
        <p>At the small-screen end of the spectrum, 12- and 13-inch laptops, or ultraportables (more on these below), are worth considering if you plan on toting your laptop. These models are small enough to weigh 3 pounds or less, but large enough that they include a full-size keyboard and a decent size-screen. The downside is that port selection tends to be minimal due to the limited amount of room available on side panels. These laptops usually serve simple needs like surfing the web or modest word processing, and they're a good choice for business travelers who need to tote a laptop frequently. Smaller 10- and 11-inch laptops (now less common than they used to be) have even less room for ports, and will have smaller keyboards and space between the keys, so you'll have to adjust your typing style to accommodate.</p>

            <h1>Ultraportables</h1>
            <p>Walk down any laptop aisle, and you'll notice that the selection of laptops has become dramatically thinner and sleeker over the last couple of years. Each of these wafer-thin systems represents a new vision for ultraportable computing: a no-compromises laptop light enough that you'll forget it's in your briefcase, with a long-lasting battery that will keep you working even when no power outlet is available. Fast storage, including 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB solid-state drives (SSD), or more affordably, 32GB to 64GB of slower eMMC flash, gives these ultraportables the ability to resume work in seconds after being idle or asleep for days. A significant slice of this market now belongs to convertible-hybrid laptops and detachable-hybrid tablets, often called "2-in-1" devices (see the next section for more information), but ultraportables are still a distinct category.

                    Most important, the entire category has thinned down in general. Whether you're looking at sliver-thin ultraportables, mainstream PCs, or even gaming machines, laptops of every flavor today are thinner, lighter, and better suited to life on the go. The best of these models will still cost you a pretty penny, particularly if you're looking for a business system that won't weigh you down when you travel for work, but they offer remarkable performance and often come with several high-end features as well. Touch screens (with 1080p resolution), full-size HDMI ports, and 8 or more hours of battery life are commonplace, and premium laptops (with premium prices) now come with high-resolution screens, up to 3,840-by-2,160 resolution (4K) at the top end.</p>
